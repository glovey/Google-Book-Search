# Google Book Searcher

### by Joe Filby

## Summary

This programme allows the user to search google books for any word or words they like. The programme makes an API 
call to the Google Books API and returns up to 5 search results, giving key details for each book.

The user can then select books from the search results to add to their reading list and then view that reading list.

The programme also gives the user the option to save their reading list when exiting the programme, and gives the
